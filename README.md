Hello! Welcome to **MechMind**!

This project is designed to assist professionals in the **mechanical industry** with writing **acceptance reports** more efficiently.  
Our goal is to build a comprehensive **database** focused on **mechanical equipment**, enabling **large language models (LLMs)** to learn domain-specific knowledge and provide users with highly targeted answers.

The inspiration for this project comes from **Pandawiki**, and development is currently ongoing.

To get started, please first download the project to your local machine. We recommend using **PyCharm IDE** for the best experience.  
Follow the setup instructions to install the required **packages**, configure the **environment**, and run **app.py**.

Once the project is running, it will display the **IP address** of your current host. Simply open that address in your browser to access the **web version of MechMind**.
